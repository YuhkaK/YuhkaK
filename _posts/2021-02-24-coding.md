### Coding-My Process and Reflection in TEI Project

This project was about creating a digital coding of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper” using Oxygen eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Editor with coding called Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a short story based on her own experience, telling the story of a woman who falls into madness. I was given a part of the passage from pages 56 through 59 to tag some text features in Oxygen.

**Using Google Docs**

Before starting to code, first, we “practiced” the feel of coding via Google Docs. Here, we marked some TEI features such as page beginnings, em-dashes, and crossed-out words using the comment feature. This process was much easier than I thought because the Google Doc feature allowed you to edit and delete any comments you made, so I didn’t have to worry about ruining the original texts and felt more comfortable putting the code features. I also felt a little special because I got to use the ```<byline>``` code because my assigned documents were the last four pages and byline was only necessary at the end. Overall, the Google Doc made me think that the coding wouldn't be too scary.

**Using TEI, XML, and Oxygen**

Unfortunately, I think it was too good to be true that coding could be this easy. When I try to set up the TEI document on my computer, there were so many texts and tags that I felt it was too difficult to learn and didn’t know what to start with. I had used a program called RStudio before, so I thought it might look similar, but it was nothing like them. 

However, the professor understood that the coding would scare everyone and helped set up TEI documents during class. The recorded video especially helped me guide the coding process and work on one sentence at a time.
At first, I had a lot of red underlines indicating that the code was invalid. However, I figured out the most error was from not correctly using the starting and ending tag such as ```<p></p>```. I also struggled to solve where to place the page beginning between the sentences, but eventually, I was able to put them between the sentences without breaking the code rules.

Even with all the struggles I encountered, at the end, when all the red underlines were gone, I felt satisfied that I was able to code all the tags. I enjoyed learning new techniques with Oxygen and TEI that I never thought I could understand in just a few classes. The Google Doc was very beneficial when checking to make sure I put every code in the TEI. Once I started grasping the necessary coding rules, I was pleased to find out I enjoyed coding more than I imagined. I hope I can learn more about TEI and Oxygen to understand the coding better in the future.
