**Summary**

_Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago_ is an online scholarly catalog that includes artworks mainly from Claude Monet and other paintings related to the artist from the nineteenth century. Funded by the Getty Foundation and the Art Institute’s David and Mary Winton Green Nineteenth-Century Research Fund, it contained forty-seven of Monet’s well-known artworks such as _Water Lily Pond_ and _Cliff Walk at Pourville_. Readers can explore artworks brought together from an organization of nine museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago, to create an enjoyable and lasting figure for online scholarly catalogs.

**Design**

The most prominent feature of the project was the use of high-resolution images. When viewing the paintings and drawings, it was clear to see the remarkable true-color photos that allow readers to zoom in closely to see the artwork’s brushstrokes and even the tiny Monet’s signatures. This project clearly shows that it is a digital humanities project because it is an online scholarly publication with more components than a printed book by using digital’s complex features through X-ray, infrared, and other technologies. The image below shows an X-ray and natural-light image of the Monet’s _Cliff Walk at Pourville_, which shows the extension of the present horizon line farther to the right. The one critique would be that this catalog did not work well with mobile devices, so for the best experience, it was best to use a browser or device at least a size of a tablet, preferably a computer-sized screen.

**Relevance**

This project did an excellent job of making the catalog easily accessible to a variety of readers. It is clear they considered accessibility and functionalities as their focus. This catalog included the artworks and made readers investigate more by having art historical research and documents. However, with so many forms about one painting, it felt a little unorganized and hard to tell if the information were relevant to the artwork itself, so it would be more pleasant to have some table of contents at the beginning. Nonetheless, with these available documents, readers can select which materials they would like to read.

**Findings**

Some of the remarkable features in this project were paragraph numbers, moving bars, and glossary. The image above shows all three components. The paragraph numbers helped readers easier to locate the text rather than page numbers. The moving bar across the bottom of the page pinpointed how much was left to read in the document. The compact glossary showed a definition of unfamiliar terms and can be opened and closed at the reader’s convenience. However, the table of contents on the left side of the catalog felt tiny and difficult to click, so it would be preferable to use bigger fonts or expand all the works of art’s list. Overall, this online platform’s exhibition produced a significant opportunity to see the artwork very closely and observe every detail of the painting. This catalog used the full benefit of features of both printed and digital catalogs. It was also made very well for various users from scholars who are an expert at art history to people who are the first time visiting the Art Institute of Chicago’s museum.
