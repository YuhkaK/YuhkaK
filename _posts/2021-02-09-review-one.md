**Summary**

_Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago_ is an online scholarly catalog of artworks created by Claude Monet from the mid-nineteenth century. The collection, funded by the Getty Foundation and the Art Institute’s David and Mary Winton Green Nineteenth-Century Research Fund, contained 47 of Monet’s well-known artworks such as _Water Lily Pond_ and _Cliff Walk at Pourville_. Readers can explore a collection of artworks from nine museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago, to create an enjoyable and lasting figure for online scholarly catalogs.

**Design**

The most prominent feature of the project was the use of high-resolution images. When viewing the paintings and drawings, the remarkable true-color photos allowed readers to zoom in closely to see the artwork’s brushstrokes and even the tiny Monet’s signatures. This project is clearly a digital humanities project because it is an online scholarly publication with more components than a printed book by using complex digital features, and through X-ray, infrared, and other technologies. The image below shows the use of X-ray and natural-light image of the Monet’s _Cliff Walk at Pourville_, which shows when both technologies combined the extension of the present horizon line farther to the right. The one critique would be that this catalog did not work well with mobile devices, so for the best experience, it was best to use a browser or device at least a size of a tablet, preferably a computer-sized screen.

**Relevance**

This project did an excellent job of making the catalog easily accessible to a variety of readers. The project’s team considered accessibility and functionalities. This catalog not only included the artworks, but it also used art historical research and documents to provide readers with even more information. However, with so many forms of the same painting on one screen/webpage, it was a little difficult to tell if the information were relevant to the artwork itself. It might be helpful for the website to have a table of contents at the beginning. Nonetheless, with these available documents, readers can select which materials they would like to read.

**Findings**

Some of the remarkable features in this project were paragraph numbers, moving bars, and the glossary; the image above shows all three components. The paragraph numbers can help readers locate the text more easily, as opposed to only relying on page numbers. The moving bar across the bottom of the page can pinpoint how much of the document the reader has still not read. The compact glossary can define unfamiliar terms and can be opened and closed at the reader’s convenience. However, the table of contents on the left side of the catalog was small and difficult to click, so it would be preferable to use bigger fonts or better to list them without folding them. Overall, the project produced a significant opportunity to see the artwork very closely and observe every detail of the painting. This catalog benefits from features of both printed and digital catalogs. It was also made accessible for various users from scholars who are experts in art history to first time visitors of the Art Institute of Chicago’s museum.
