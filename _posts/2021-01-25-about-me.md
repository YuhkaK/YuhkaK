# About Me, Yuhka Kaneda

**_Introduction_**

My name is Yuhka Kaneda. I am currently a sophomore studying at Christopher Newport University. I am majoring in management in the [Luter School of Business](https://cnu.edu/academics/departments/business/).

**_Career Interests_**

My career interest is that I want to enter the career field immediately after graduation. To succeed in the job field, I plan to find an internship during the junior or senior year, so I could get an opportunity to experience the workplace and become familiar before going to the working field after graduation.

**_Academic or personal success_**

I have volunteered at [Newport News Japanese School](http://www.japan-virginia.org/JapaneseSchools.html) for approximately two years. There are limited numbers of available teachers to help students, so I had the opportunity to help teachers and students with any extra help, such as grading tests and assisting with classwork. English is not my native language, so working with students from similar backgrounds gave me valuable life experience.

**_Some personal tidbits_**

I enjoy drawing in my free time and it has become one of my passions. Drawing is one of the only things that I can focus so much on that I forget the passing of time. The image you see below is some of my art projects at the Art Show during the senior year of high school. Some of my artworks are 2D, while some are 3D. I mainly worked 2D work with mediums such as 
* Paints (watercolor and acrylic)
* Pencils
* Color pencils 
* Charcoals

For 3D, I have only tried with ceramics, but I am interested in working more with 3D material such as papers in the future.

**_Finally…_**

This blog is one of the projects from ENGL 350, which is writing-intensive for Digital Humanities. 
Before taking this class, I was unsure what DH was and have only heard of basic concepts. However, I decided to take this course to fulfill my WI requirement.
Taking this course opened my view for the DH that I didn’t know I was interested in. Utilizing many digital platforms such as Twitter and Github made me realize there are so many tools available to spread academic knowledge and share it with the rest of the world. I also see that any information posted on the network is said to last a **lifetime**, so I want to be careful and at the same time be a better writer so I can explore what I can make full use of out of the digital world.
