**Summary**

_The Museum of the World_ is an online scholarly catalog of artworks that has a unique feature of interactive experience from the collaboration between the British Museum and the Google Culture Institute. This project contains hundreds of objects in human history from prehistory ages to the present times. Readers can explore a collection of artworks from across diverse cultures on one website.

**Design**

The most incredible feature of the project is the overall designs of a vivid and beautiful project is. The artworks are organized in horizontal and vertical ways. In horizontal, it is broken up into continents with different colors: Africa (yellow), Americas (orange), Asia (green), Europe (blue), and Oceania (purple). For vertical, it is broken up into years from 2,000,000 BC to AD 2,000, presenting that they have ancient artwork to more recent artworks. When clicking on each dot, it shows the artworks, and you can zoom in on all these artworks in ways you couldnâ€™t even do at a museum. 

This website uses one of the most advanced WebGL (Web Graphics Library) technology available. This program enhanced to make one of the best combinations of 2D and 3D graphics. However, the WebGL did not work with mobile devices, so for the best experience, it was best to use a browser or device at least a size of a tablet, preferably a laptop or desktop.
