**Summary**

_The Museum of the World_ is a virtual museum with a unique feature that enables an interactive experience in collaboration between the British Museum and the Google Culture Institute. This project contains hundreds of cultural objects of human history from prehistory ages to the present times. Readers can explore a collection of alluring artworks from across diverse continents on one website.

**Design**

The most incredible feature of the project is the overall design of the vivid and beautiful project. When first entering the website, it takes a few minutes to load all the information, but it is entertaining to see all the colorful dots forming. The graphics are organized in horizontal and vertical axes. In the horizontal axis, the artworks are broken up into continents with different colors: Africa (yellow), Americas (orange), Asia (green), Europe (blue), and Oceania (purple). For vertical, it is broken up into years from ancient works in 2,000,000 BC to more recent artworks in AD 2,000. When clicking on each dot, it shows the artworks, and you can zoom in on all these artworks in ways you couldn’t ever do at a museum.

The visible feature of the digital humanities is using one of the most advanced WebGL (Web Graphics Library) technologies available. This program was enhanced to make one of the best combinations of 2D and 3D graphics. However, since the WebGL did not work with mobile devices, for the best experience, it was best to use a browser or device at least the size of a tablet, preferably a laptop or desktop.

**Relevance**

This project did a magnificent job of making it enjoyable to display artworks from around the world. When clicking on one of the dots, it connects with other dots to show the relationships with those artworks. However, it is hard to understand the connections between each dot and how they’re intertwined. Perhaps the materials or colors are similar to each other, but there is no explanation, so it is unclear. On the right side of the website, there is a tab that allows users to highlight individual types of dots into other categories such as art and design, power and identity, and trade and conflict so that users can narrow down the amounts of dots.

The timeline on the left side is also an engaging way of showing that time is moving on in all continents simultaneously. It is very easy to search and compare what happened around the world and what was created in each country.

**Findings**

One of the key features in this project is when a user moves the mouse over to a circle, it makes a beautiful metallophone sound. It added a little special touch to the project, and if the sounds are distracting, there is an option to click the volume button on the top right and mute the sounds. When clicking on the circle, the label pops up with lots of interactive tools. Each artwork has audios that read the explanation and location of where the artwork is from with maps. Related objects can also be clicked on and zoomed in and can share with friends and relatives by Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook. However, once clicking away from the circle, it is a little challenging to search back to the objects seen before, so it would be beneficial to make a feature that changes the dot's color once clicking them.

Overall, the project was very pleasant to explore. Without a doubt, it is a fantastic opportunity to see the artwork very closely and explore some of the collections. It is just like visiting a museum in real life with all the information displayed. Even further, all the highlights and connections already made for viewers help explore artworks much faster than traditional museums. It is such a creative and elegant invention that many audiences can be excited to learn and explore something new.
